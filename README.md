# TextMate for Visual Studio Code

This extension aims at recreating the TextMate experience in Visual Studio Code. It is a work in progress and is not yet ready for use.

## Features

### Keybindings

A good amount of keybindings have been ported from TextMate.

### `windowTitle`

You can now use `scmBranchName` in the `windowTitle` setting.

### Bracket/Block Navigation

You can now navigate between brackets and blocks using `ctrl` with `up` and `down`, adding `shift` to also update the selection.
